# Lab 5 â€“ UI Frameworks 
This project demonstrates the use of Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React.js for building styled and interactive UI components.

## Folders:

- **bootstrap-demo**: HTML page using Bootstrap with navbar, grid layout, button, and alert.
- **tailwind-demo**: Responsive card section styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **react-demo**: `App.js` for a React app that uses props and state.

## Experience:

Each framework was used without custom CSS. Bootstrap was quick for layout, Tailwind offered precise utility classes, and React simplified DOM interaction using state and props.

## Completed Features:
- Bootstrap: Navbar, Grid, Button, Alert
- Tailwind: Responsive card with image, text, and button
- React: Component with props and `useState()` toggle
